**Summary:**

This document is a tutorial in digital photography.  The content will cover how digital photography differs from traditional film photography and what benefits and drawbacks it holds against film.  Everyone knows what a camera does, but not many how it achieves the final picture.  This specific topic has always fascinated me as I began taking a personal interest in photography and I believe that it is useful information for anyone interested in photography.

**Audience:**

I hope this tutorial serves to educate novice photographers in understanding the magic that is happening inside their camera and allow them to make a more educated decision when deciding what method of photography they would like to pursue.
