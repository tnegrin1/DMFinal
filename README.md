**Summary:**

This document is a tutorial in digital photography.  The content will cover how digital photography differs from traditional film photography and what benefits and drawbacks it holds against film.  Everyone knows what a camera does, but not many how it achieves the final picture.  This specific topic has always fascinated me as I began taking a personal interest in photography and I believe that it is useful information for anyone interested in photography.

**Audience:**

I hope this tutorial serves to educate novice photographers of any age in understanding the magic that is happening inside their camera and allow them to make a more educated decision when deciding what method of photography they would like to pursue.  Both film and digital have their advantages and disadvantages and it's important for new photographers to know what sets them apart before they commit to one method.
