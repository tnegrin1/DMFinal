Digital Photography has revolutionized the world of digital multimedia and the way we capture and consume entertainment.  While film still has it's place in the world of photography, digital has introduced an immediacy and convenience that is unrivaled with traditional methods of photography.  To understand the implementation and impact of digital photography, we must first understand how a traditional camera works.

A traditional film camera is composed of three elements: the optical (lens), the chemical (film), and the mechanical (shutter/body).

### Mechanical

At its core, a camera is essentially a box with a small pinhole at one end that allows light to enter and be projected on the inside.  Due to the nature of the light's entry through the pinhole, the image appears reversed on the projected surface.

This "box" is the essential design of a camera body that allows for the capture of an image.  The other major component of any camera body is the shutter.

The shutter of a camera is a mechanical curtain that blocks light entry from the chemical element of a camera.  When triggered, the shutter will lower, allowing light to enter the body.  The light then makes contact with the chemical element to create an exposure.  These two features combined, comprise the mechanical element of a camera.

### Optical

Before light can even enter a camera's body it first passes through a camera's optical element or lens.  A lens is used to focus light at concentrated point by bending the light rays as they pass through the glass element.

Different light waves move at different speeds and come from different directions, so a optical lens is necessary to slow the light and focus it onto the chemical element of the camera for a more detailed image.  Lenses nowadays are actually comprised of several different lens elements.  A lens's two main features that affect the resulting image are it's focal length and aperture.

The aperture of a lens is the size of the hole that allows in light.  The lower the aperture number, the larger the hole.  At a lower aperture, the lens allows in more light which results in a brighter image, and a shallower depth of field.

The focal length of lens is the distance between the first optical element and the chemical element of the camera.  The higher the focal length, the more zoomed in an image will appear in the projection.

### Chemical

Finally, we have the chemical element of the camera.  In traditional cameras, this element is known as film.  Film is a thin, flexible strip of plastic, that is coated in a light-sensitive emulsion.  The film is placed at the back of camera body where the light is projected in when the camera shutter is triggered.  The film reacts to the light by exposing the lights and dark into a resulting image known as a negative.

This negative is then carefully processed in a dark room to reverse the tones into an accurate depiction of the subject matter originally captured.  Editing possibility is very limited in this process and requires a lot of skill.  Once a negative is fully processed, a photographer can then use a high-resolution scanner to convert the image to a digital form.

This chemical element is the aspect that has set digital photography apart from traditional film.

## Digital Sensors

Instead of film, a digital camera utilizes a digital sensor that converts light into electrical charges that can be directly stored as bits and bytes.  The two main digital sensors used in cameras today are Charge Coupled Device (CCD) and Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS).  These sensors are comprised of a two-dimensional array of solar cells, that when struck by light, store an electrical charge.  Once an exposure is complete, the sensor will read each value of these cells and convert it to a digital representation that can be read by a computer.

Theses sensors are also significant in there accurate color reproduction.  While the sensor's photosites (cells) themselves are essentially colorblind, the sensor will utilize filtering of each of the image's three primary color channels (RGB) individually, to store an accurate representation of the full color spectrum in the image.

This method of photography is revolutionary for two reasons. One, it allows for a much quicker and easier method to capturing, editing, and storing images.  No more long sessions in the dark room, dodging and burning, waiting for the final image to process.  Digital cameras are immediate in their processing and they also offer a lot more options in post production of the image with digital editing programs like Photoshop and Lightroom.  Two, it allows for an exorbitant amount of capture potential with the power of digital storage on SD cards.  With film, a photographer would have to pay for it by the roll, and once it was used, it was gone.  Not only was the amount you could carry severely limited, but the film was not reusable, whereas with a digital camera, you can reuse the same SD card over and over again if you have an alternate place to store the data.

The only real drawback digital suffers when compared to film is the resolution potential of the image captures.  Because film negatives can be produced much larger than digital sensors, film is a much better alternative for someone who is concerned more with the resolution output of their image, than the convenience of digital.
